    <h1><u>BORN A CRIME BOOK REVIEW</u></h1>
      <img src="boook.jpg">
    <h2><u>Theme:Patriarchy and Male chauvinism.</u></h2>
    <p class="Review">
    In this story,<em>Born a crime</em> written by Trevor Noah,Abel-Patricia's husband is portrayed as a toxic ,abusive and insecure man. On the other hand ,Patricia is portrayed as a fearless and independent woman.Despite of Abel being violent, she does not give up on being his wife.
    
    When she gives birth to their son,Andrew,the make a trip to Abel's  family for the christmas holidays.Abel expects Patriciah to be that traditional wife to him that does all the house chores and respects their husbands to the extent of bowing to them to greet them.He knows pretty well that Patriciah is a modern woman and he pushes himself to try and change that about her,whereas she wanted to just walk around the village and hang around where men were...<em>..."Patricia Noah didn't stay in anyone's kitchen.She was a free-roaming spirit."</em>"She always wanted the best for her husband no matter how modern of a woman she was.<br><br>

    Patriarchy is a system of a society where men hold the power and women are largely executed from it.Patricia detested every bit of the way Tzaneen women bowed down to their husbands.Abel saw this as disrespect.He compared himself with the men who had "traditional women".This brought wrangles between them several times. Abel tried to control how they would live as a family.Abel knew very well what he was getting himself into when marrying Patricia-the miss independent-but still went ahead.I tend to think that he wanted to take control of her and by that he would feel powerful.Abel being the man he was still needed the "modern-woman" in Patricia because at some point when he was broke she would pay his house rent and also take care of other bills.Patricia was also good at business management and hence would run the garage business and it would make profits.This made Abel feel humiliated.<em> "And it was going well,until Abel started to feel like she was running the business".</em>

     <h2><u>Humour and it's impact on Trevor's life.</u></h2>

     <p class="humour">
       In the apartheid times in S.Africa being Africans were not allowed to have sexual relations with Europeans.If they did they would be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to imprisonment for a period of five years.When Patricia gave birth to a half-white,half-black child who violated any number of laws nd regulations-he was born a crime.Growing up,it was hard for Trevoh to associate with other kids or also go out with his parents because he was a colored kid.<br><br>

       Humour is the ability to be amusing or comic.This played a major role in Noah's life since he was a clown.Trevoh was a funny boy who joked about everything.When his mother took him to the park and police came around, he says that she would drop him and pretend he wasn't hers,<em>"like he was a bag of weed".</em>When  Trevor was still a young boy he was a naughty kid.His mother would not spare the rod and spoil the kid.The way he describes his Patricia's way of punishing him is very humorous,,<em>Nobody ran like me and my mom.She wasn't one of those "come over here and get your hiding" type moms.She'd deliver it to you free of charge.</em>Trevor describes his relationship with his mother as "Tom and Jerry relationship".It's funny how a nAfrican mother would chase her kid down the streets just to punish their kids,,his mother did nt mind what people would say.When she couldn't catch any more,she would use her tricks by referring to him as a thief when he tried running away from a punishment...<em>"So,she'd yell "Thief!" knowing it would bring the whole neighborhood out against me,and i'd have strangers trying to grab me and tackle me ,and i'd have to duck and dive and dodge them as well,all the while screaming,"I am not a thief i'm on her son!"</em>
       When Trevoh was five years old,he was home alone and needed to go use the toilet but there was a heavy downpour.Since he thought he was home alone,he decided to shit on a newspaper in the house and then take it to the toilet.He defined the experience as powerful and magical...<em>"I think God made humans shit in the way we do because it brings us back down to earth and gives us humility."..."When we shit we forget all our airs and our graces, we forget how famous or rich we are.All of that goes away."</em> <br><br>When he was Sandringham High school,he found trouble making friends because he was a coloured kid.He did not have a group to identify himself with.The only reason that tey talked to him was because he was the fastest kid in the school and so he would make it to the tuck shop and buy them everything they wanted and they would pay him or give him food.They also loved him because he was good at telling jokes.He says in the book,<em>"You don't have to be accepted for everything you are, just the one part of yourself that you are willing to share.For me it was humour.I learned that even though i didn't belong to one group,I could be a part of any group that was laughing."....."I'd catch abit of their conversation,learn more about their group, and then leave.I never overstayed my welcome.I wasn't popular ,but i wasn't an outcast." </em>.Humour made him feel comfortable with everyone else even though he was all by himself.<br><br>
       Trevor found it difficult to get girls to date.He didn't afford decent haircuts,used to wear baggy clothes,high ass and he was also suffering from pustules.He did not have a girlfriend and also did not try asking them out.He did not have a problem talking to them though.They like him because he always made them laugh.<em>Human beings like to laugh and lucky for me pretty girls are human beings.</em><br>
