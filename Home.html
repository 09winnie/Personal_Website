     <p class="humour">
       In the apartheid times in S.Africa being Africans were not allowed to have sexual relations with Europeans.If they did they would be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to imprisonment for a period of five years.When Patricia gave birth to a half-white,half-black child who violated any number of laws nd regulations-he was born a crime.Growing up,it was hard for Trevoh to associate with other kids or also go out with his parents because he was a colored kid.<br>

       Humour is the ability to be amusing or comic.Trevoh was a funny boy who joked about everything.When his mother took him to the park and police came around, he says that she would drop him and pretend he wasn't hers,<em>"like he was a bag of weed".</em>
       When Trevoh was five years old,he was home alone and needed to go use the toilet but there was a heavy downpour.Since he thought he was home alone,he decided to shit on a newspaper in the house and then take it to the toilet.He defined the experience as powerful and magical...<em>"I think God made humans shit in the way we do because it brings us back down to earth and gives us humility."..."When we shit we forget all our airs and our graces, we forget how famous or rich we are.All of that goes away."</em> <br>When he was Sandringham High school,he found trouble making friends because he was a coloured kid.He did not have a group to identify himself with.The only reason that tey talked to him was because he was the fastest kid in the school and so he would make it to the tuck shop and buy them everything they wanted and they would pay him or give him food.THey also loved him because he was good at telling jokes.He says in the book,<em>"You don't have to be accepted for everything you are, just the one part of yourself that you are willing to share.For me it was humour.I learned that even though i didn't belong to one group,I could be a part of any group that was laughing."....."I'd catch abit of their conversation,learn more about their group, and then leave.I never overstayed my welcome.I wasn't popular ,but i wasn't an outcast." </em>.Humour made him feel comfortable with everyone else even though he was all by himself.<br>
       Trevor found it difficult to get girls to date.He didn't afford decent haircuts,used to wear baggy clothes,high ass,and he was also suffering from pustules.He did not have a girlfriend and also did not try asking them out.He did not have a problem talking to them though.They like him because he always made them laugh.<em>Human beings like to laugh and lucky for me pretty girls are human beings.</em>
